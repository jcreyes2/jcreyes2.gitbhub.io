As a microbiologist I was first introduced into ‘big data’ when I was analyzing some RNA-Seq data that had already
been cleaned, processed, and formatted for the researcher to look over. For those of you unfamiliar of the technique, 
RNA-Seq allows researchers to investigate the total cellular content of RNAs and give researchers an insight 
into interactions that are occurring between various genes. From the data obtained, I was directed in the proper 
direction to continue pushing the project that was assigned to me. I immediately became intrigued with 
understanding how data collected could be used to answer questions. To start off, I decided to begin with some simple
data visualization.

Using Chicago’s public life expectancy by community I decided to answer a simple question. 
* How has Chicago's life expectancy changed over time?

I accomplished this by:

1.	Cleaning, and analyzing public life expectancy data taken from Chicago’s open data platform.
2.	Visualized life expectancy by community by plotting their geographical location.

I obtained the full data-set by calling the Chicago Data Portal API, followed by some cleaning:

```python
def get_data():
    client = sodapy.Socrata("data.cityofchicago.org", None)
    results = client.get("qjr3-bm53", limit=2000)
    return results

data = get_data()

#convert data to pandas data frame
results_df = pd.DataFrame(data)

#check for any null values in the whole dataframe
results_df.isnull().values.any()

#drop any null values
results_df.dropna()
```

I read in a publicly available shape-file of Chicago in order to visualize the life-expectancy by location on a map.
```python
    #reading in data for community areas to plot geographically
df = geopandas.read_file('geo_export_6b384d2c-6f53-4951-afa4-d7e6fd8fc85f.shp')
```
I cleaned the data by removing any null values, renaming columns, removing any special characters. Followed by joining the shape file with the data-set.
```python
df['community'] = df['community'].str.lower()
df['community'] = df['community'].str.replace(r"[\"\'\ \,]", '')
df['community'] = df['community'].astype(str)

#convert numerical data to floats / make all strings lowercase 
results_df['community_area'] = results_df['community_area'].str.lower()
results_df['community_area'] = results_df['community_area'].str.replace(r"[\"\'\ \,]", '')
results_df['_1990_life_expectancy'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['_1990_life_expectancy'])
results_df['_1990_lower_95_ci'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['_1990_lower_95_ci'])
results_df['_1990_upper_95_ci'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['_1990_upper_95_ci'])
results_df['_2000_life_expectancy'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['_2000_life_expectancy'])
results_df['_2000_lower_95_ci'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['_2000_lower_95_ci'])
results_df['_2000_upper_95_ci'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['_2000_upper_95_ci'])
results_df['_2010_life_expectancy'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['_2010_life_expectancy'])
results_df['_2010_lower_95_ci'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['_2010_lower_95_ci'])
results_df['_2010_upper_95_ci'] = pd.to_numeric(results_df['_2010_upper_95_ci'])

#renaming columns for simplicity
results_df = results_df.rename(columns = {'_1990_life_expectancy': '1990', '_2000_life_expectancy' : '2000',
                             '_2010_life_expectancy': '2010'})

#joining CRS coordinates with data
merged = df.join(results_df)
```

Finally, I plotted the data collected from 1989-1990, 1999-2000, and 2009-2010 on a choropleth map to visualize the life expectancy on a map.
```python
fig, (p1, p2, p3) = plt.subplots(nrows = 1, ncols = 3, figsize = (15, 25))
gs1 = gridspec.GridSpec(15,25)
gs1.update(wspace = 0.05)

# set the min and max range for the choropleth map
vmin, vmax = 50, 85

#each invidiual chloropeth map using column as argument
p1 = merged.plot(column = '1990', vmin = vmin, ax = p1, vmax = vmax, norm = plt.Normalize(vmin = vmin,vmax = vmax))
p2 = merged.plot(column = '2000', vmin = vmin, ax = p2,vmax = vmax, norm = plt.Normalize(vmin = vmin,vmax = vmax))
p3 = merged.plot(column = '2010', vmin = vmin, ax = p3,vmax = vmax, norm = plt.Normalize(vmin = vmin,vmax = vmax))

#setting title/removing axis of each individual map
p1.set_title('1990')
p2.set_title('2000')
p3.set_title('2010')
p1.axis('off')
p2.axis('off')
p3.axis('off')

#obtaining characteristic of one plot to add legend
back = p3.get_figure()
#trial and error to get the legend in place [l, b, w, h]
#l:left, b:bottom, w:width, h:height; in normalized unit (0-1)
#'cbax' is just a blank axes, with un needed labels on x and y axes.
cbax = back.add_axes([0.95, 0.4, 0.03, 0.2])
cbax.set_title('life expectancy')


#colormap that is being normalized to be shared amongst all three
sm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(norm = plt.Normalize(vmin = vmin, vmax = vmax))
sm._A = []
back.colorbar(sm, cax = cbax, format = '%d')
plt.savefig('filename.png')
```
