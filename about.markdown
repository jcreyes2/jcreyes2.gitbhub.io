Hello! My name is Juan Reyes.

I am a microbiologist with an interest in how data can be used to understand the way of living. Such as predicting 
novel markers for cancer so they can be better studied. As well as trying to correlate lifestyle to diseases. 

After obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Molecular and Cellular Biology from the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign,
I proceeded to join Dr. Liang Qiao’s Immunology lab at Loyola University of Chicago’s Center for Translational facility.
I began doing research understanding the microbiome and how it modulates intestinal inflammation. The lab had progressed 
the project quite far focusing on Lactobacillus, a known probiotic, and I was given the task of performing an experiment 
that would allow us to gain an insight as to what was going on. I proposed we performed RNA-Seq. This RNA-Seq experiment
was my first introduction into seeing the endless suggestions data can tell us once it's analyzed and modeled. The RNA-Seq data directed me into suggesting probable receptors Lactobacillus was acting upon in order to perform its functions and remain a commensal (friendly) in the gut of humans. Unfortunately, this project is still on-going, and I can't go into further detail. However, once the paper is published, I will provide a link.

Looking over the RNA-Seq data piqued my interest into data integration. data analysis, and data mining. There, are tons 
of new things we can learn from data that is already out there.

This then pushed me to begin my first EDA (exploratory data analysis) into understanding the demographics of my hometown, 
Chicago, a little bit more.

Doing so, introduced me to the numerous tools Data Analyst, and Data scientist use to analyze and model data. 
Such as R, Python, PostgreSQL, and Jupyter just to name a few. As well as resources to obtain data such as web scraping, 
Kaggle, data portals, etc. 

Please take a look over my projects and let me know of any comments, suggestions, or questions!
